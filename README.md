# Commander Primer

An introduction to deckbuilding for the Magic: The Gathering (MTG) Commander format by Kyle Kovacs

### How to use this guide

This guide is meant for people who already know how to play Magic, but don't know anything about Commander. Throughout the guide, concepts will be introduced and explained, and any cards that are referenced will show up as images. There is a glossary of terms at the bottom. By the end of the guide, you should have a pretty clear idea of what Commander is all about and how to build a deck. My recommendation is to read the entire guide before starting to build your deck, but if you can't wait, then following along will work as well.

## What is commander?

There are many different ways to play MTG, called **formats**. A format is defined by a specific set of deckbuilding rules. Each official format contains rules about how many cards are allowed to be in a deck, which cards are allowed to be played, how many players are in a game, how mulligans work, and sometimes a few other rules.

The main formats supported by Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) are Vintage, Legacy, Modern, Pauper, Standard, Commander, Booster Draft, Sealed, and Brawl. Each of these formats has its own set of legal cards and its own restrictions on deck size. This article will not cover the details of the differences between the formats, but this highlights the fact that there are many ways to play MTG, each with its own set of specific rules and metagames.

So what is the Commander format? Let's take a look at the rules in detail.

### Commander deckbuilding rules

The deckbuilding rules are the following:

- Decks contain exactly 100 cards
- Decks are singleton (each deck can only contain one copy of a given card)
- One card in the deck is designated as the "commander" of the deck
  - The commander must be a legendary creature
- All the non-commander cards in the deck must fall under the "color identity" of the commander.
  - Color identity is determined by the mana symbols on the card in either the card's cost or its rules text. For example, the card Ancient Grudge is red, but its color identity is red and green. Hybrid mana symbols, like those seen in Dovescape count as both colors when determining the card's color and when determining its color identity. Hence, Dovescape is blue and white, and its color identity is blue and white.

    > Note that mana symbols in reminder text do not count as mana symbols in a card's rules text. Example: the _Extort_ mechanic, as seen in Blind Obedience does not change a card's color identity. Blind Obedience is white, and its color identity is white.

  - Of course, the cards in the deck do not have to exactly match the color identity of the commander. So if a deck's commander were blue, red, and black, then the deck could have cards that are just blue, cards that are red and black, cards that are just black, etc.

Your commander is usually what gives your deck its flavor. Most decks are structured such that the cards all interact well with the abilities of the deck's commander. Later on in the guide, we will explore what this means and how it works.

In addition to the deckbuilding rules, there are some in-game rules specific to Commander.

### Commaner game rules

The relevant game rules are the following:

- You may not have known it, but in every game of MTG there is a zone called the _command zone_. This is where commanders live at the start of the game, and it's where they normally return to when they die.

  > Note, the command zone is also used for other things with which you may be familiar, such as planeswalker emblems and conspiracies.

- You may cast your commander from the command zone as if it were in your hand.
- Any time a commander you own would change zones, you may have it go to the command zone instead of whatever zone it would have gone to. This means, for example, that if your commander is on the battlefield and it is destroyed, you may put it in the command zone instead of in your graveyard. Likewise, if your commander is in your graveyard (perhaps because you chose not to return it to the command zone after it died) and it would be exiled, you may choose to return it to the command zone instead.
  - Keep in mind that a commander that returns to the command zone when it is destroyed doesn't actually die. Since moving to the command zone is a replacement effect, the commander never enters the graveyard, and so never actually triggers any "whenever a creature dies..."-type abilities.
- Every time you cast your commander from the command zone, it costs 2 more generic mana to cast for each time you have cast it from the command zone that game.
- If a player is dealt 21 damage (over half their starting life total) by a single commander, that player loses the game as a state-based action.
  - This so-called "commander damage" is tracked across the whole game, even if the damage-dealing commander leaves and re-enters the battlefield many times.
  - Noncombat damage also counts as commander damage.
- Players start at 40 life
- Each player gets 1 free mulligan (you can draw back up to 7 after your first mulligan, then 6 after your second, etc.)
- The player who goes first does not skip their draw step

Commander is best played with 4 players at a time. If a player loses the game, all cards owned by that player cease to exist (from the game's perspective) and the game continues on with the remaining players. If a player wins the game, the game ends and all other players lose.

A big part of what makes the format fun is the in-game politics. Some games play out relatively evenly, while other games see one player gain an early advantage and get teamed up on. The fun of commander is that even though your deck has the same cards in it, no two games play out the same way. Often in formats like Standard, which has a very narrow metagame, matchups can be deterministic and the same matchup will often play out the same way. This does not mean that Standard is boring, but it's definitely a different feeling and Commander has such a wide variety of things going on that it never seems to get boring.


> **History Note**: Commander is often called Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH). This is a reference to 2 things. First, when Commander was invented, the only legal commanders were the five Elder Dragons, pictured below. Second, the movie _Highlander_ popularaized the phrase "there can only be one," which refers to the singleton nature of Commander.

So, what is Commander?

Commander is **_THE_** casual format. Commander is where you can experiment. Your deck can be whatever you want it to be. You can play weird, random cards that were printed in 1998 that aren't good enough for Modern. Also, the decks are a lot less consistent in general, because your deck is 100 cards instead of 60, and you only have 1 copy of each. This means that it's a lot less about curving out in the first few turns. It's a lot harder to deprive 3 opponents of resources. It's much more difficult to kill people on turn 3 with simple combat damage. The tight, competative style of other constructed formats is broken down and replaced with a relaxed attitude of fun for the sake of fun.

Now that we've covered what Commander is and how it works, it's time (finally!) to talk about building a deck.
