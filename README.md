## What is commander?

There are many different ways to play MTG, called *formats*. A format is defined by a specific set of deckbuilding rules. Each official format contains rules about how many cards are allowed to be in a deck, which cards are allowed to be played, how many players are in a game, how mulligans work, and sometimes a few other rules.

The main formats supported by Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) are Vintage, Legacy, Modern, Pauper, Standard, Commander, Booster Draft, Sealed, and Brawl. Each of these formats has its own set of legal cards and its own restrictions on deck size. This article will not cover the details of the differences between the formats, but this highlights the fact that there are many ways to play MTG, each with its own set of specific rules and metagames.

So what is the Commander format? The main rules are the following:
